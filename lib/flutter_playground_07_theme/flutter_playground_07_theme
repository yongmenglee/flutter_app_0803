# Android UI and UX Material Design

## What's UI?

### UI - User Interface

Anything designed to be interacted with.
Smart phones, tablets, websites, desktop etc

### What Makes a Good UI?

1. Clarity - inspires confidence - further use - predictable
2. Enables Interaction - feel inspired/part of the world
3. Focused - focus @ one primary item only.
4. Keep Users in Control - more comfortable.
5. Provide a Natural next Step - what comes next? Don't let user hanging.
6. Intuitive - Appearance follows behaviour - no surprise - feel included.


## UX - User Experience

Good Experience = Good Interaction

**Useful** - Desirable - **Valuable** - Accessible - Findable - **Credible** - Usable

=> Value.

- Pretty is not part of a good UI.
